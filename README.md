# Smarterhome

The project is focused on using the Tado smart thermostats
for establishing whether the home is empty or not, for
leveraging the geofencing to other tools and devices.

Currently there are also aspects of using the data feed
for other data analysis, as the weather and air quality data
looks intriguing :)

## Learning tasks

So fair I have additional things I want to get out of this
project. In no particular order:

1. Make sure that pytest is used from the get-go
1. Use Code coverage to ensure testing is done proficiently
1. Let documentation be done properly
1. Use a class construct to facilitate easier use of say APIs
and other interesting interactions
1. Use Githubs way of storing keys outside of the repo for safe
access

## Sources of knowledge

Right now my primary sources of input on interacting with
my TADO is from these links:
